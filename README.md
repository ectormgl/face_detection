# Welcome to this repository! üëã

**This is a simple application that detects your face using the [Haarcascade Frontal face](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) from OpenCV library**

## What is Haarcascade?

We can follow the definition at [this article from Girija Shankar](https://towardsdatascience.com/face-detection-with-haar-cascade-727f68dafd08):


"... It is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video. The algorithm uses edge or line detection features proposed by Viola and Jones in their research paper [‚ÄúRapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features‚Äù](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf) published in 2001. The algorithm is given a lot of positive images consisting of faces, and a lot of negative images not consisting of any face to train on them. "

## How do I run it?

- **Firtly:** clone this repository at your command prompt using this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/ectormgl/face_detection
``` 
- **Second step:** Again at your command prompt, run this command to download the dependencies (you must have python installed, if not, [click here!](https://www.python.org/downloads/)):
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
- **Third Step:** Run the "main.py" file via any code app (like VS code) or you can run at command prompt again (This command is adapted to Windows, please use the equivalent in your Linux, MAC ...):
```python
python ./main.py
```
- **Expected Result:** This what the expected result look like:


### This is my first project using Computer Vision and I working so hard to keep my profile update with new projects!
Thanks for being here!
